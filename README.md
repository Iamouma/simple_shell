The Simple Shell Project
A shell is a program that executes other programs in response to text commands.
A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems.
The Shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.
